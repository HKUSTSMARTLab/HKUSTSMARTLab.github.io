On April 30, 2025, the **HKUST Smart Lab** team, led by **Prof. Hao Chen**, had a fruitful dialogue with **Shenzhen People’s Hospital**. The discussion focused on the [MOME model](https://smartlab.cse.ust.hk/2024/08/28/mome/), an AI-powered breast cancer diagnosis model developed by HKUST Smart Lab. This model has shown remarkable performance in assisting medical professionals with breast cancer diagnosis.

The dialogue was attended by **Prof. Chen** and **Dr. Wu Mingxiang** from Shenzhen People’s Hospital. The meeting provided an excellent opportunity for both teams to exchange ideas and explore potential collaborations in the field of AI-driven healthcare.

The MOME model, which stands for **Mixture of Modality Experts**, is a state-of-the-art AI model that integrates the  multiparametric MRI (mpMRI) data. The model has been trained on the largest dataset and has demonstrated its ability to provide reliable diagnostic support for medical professionals.             

The collaboration between HKUST Smart Lab and Shenzhen People’s Hospital aims to further refine the MOME model and explore its potential applications in clinical settings. The dialogue highlighted the importance of interdisciplinary collaboration in advancing AI technologies for healthcare, ultimately benefiting patients and improving medical outcomes.
The meeting also emphasized the significance of AI in transforming the healthcare landscape, particularly in the early detection and diagnosis of diseases. By leveraging advanced AI technologies, healthcare professionals can enhance their diagnostic capabilities, leading to more accurate and timely interventions for patients.

Following the meeting, both teams expressed their enthusiasm for future collaborations and the potential impact of AI in healthcare. The HKUST Smart Lab team is committed to continuing its research in AI-driven healthcare solutions, with the goal of improving patient outcomes and revolutionizing medical practices.
