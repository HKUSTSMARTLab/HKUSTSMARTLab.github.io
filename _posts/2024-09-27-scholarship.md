HKUST CSE UG student Mr. Runsheng LIU was selected as 2023-2024's Tse Cheuk Ng Tai Scholarship recipient with his UROP (Undergraduate Research Opportunity Program) study titled "Deep learning for medical image analysis". The project, supervised by Pro.Hao CHEN, was to develop deep learning algorithms and image processing techniques for medical image analysis. During this UROP project, Mr. Runsheng LIU has finished a work named "GAInS: Gradient Anomaly-aware Biomedical Instance Segmentation". This work presents a unified and general approach for touching, overlapping, and crossing instances in biomedical instance segmentation which leverages instance gradient information. This work is received by the 2024 IEEE International Conference on Bioinformatics and Biomedicine (IEEE BIBM 2024).


Tse Cheuk Ng Tai Scholarship was established in 2017 by Mr. Paul TSE. It aims to award one CSE student every year with outstanding research performance in the field of artificial intelligence and computer vision.
