## Research and Application of Artificial Intelligence in Pathological and Genomic Computing

This talk will provide an overview of the research and development conducted at Tencent AI Lab in the field of AI for life sciences, with a specific focus on two key areas: pathological analysis and genomic computing. Pathology serves as the gold standard for accurate diagnosis, prognosis, and treatment management. However, pathology diagnosis is complex and subjective and there is heavy shortage for trained pathologists. Genes, as the fundamental elements of life, play a pivotal role in determining inheritance, diseases, appearance, and aging in living organisms. The exponential growth of medical and biological data, surpassing Moore's Law, necessitates the development of new AI algorithms capable of analyzing vast and complex medical and biological data. This talk will delve into the advancements made in AI algorithms to enhance the analysis of pathology and genomic data, along with their clinical applications in disease diagnosis, drug development, and therapy, highlighting their potential to revolutionize the field of life sciences.
