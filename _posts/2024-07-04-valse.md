Abstract:

Minimally invasive surgery has significant advantages such as small trauma, fast recovery, and fewer postoperative complications, and it is widely used in the treatment of diseases in fields such as oncology, head and neck surgery, and orthopedics. Surgical navigation provides "eyes" for minimally invasive surgery, significantly improving the precision, safety, and efficiency of surgeries. This report focuses on core issues such as preoperative intelligent planning, intraoperative intelligent perception, and intelligent guidance of targets in surgical navigation. It introduces the research progress of the team in multi-modal image intelligent analysis, including image segmentation modeling, image elastic registration and fusion, and motion deformation perception and compensation, as well as the development and clinical application of multi-modal image fusion augmented reality surgical navigation systems.

Abstract:

Robotic-assisted surgery has revolutionized modern minimally invasive surgery by significantly enhancing the dexterity and overall capability of surgeons. Automatic and intelligent visual analysis is fundamentally crucial for promoting cognitive assistance in robotic-assisted surgery. In this talk, I will present our latest interdisciplinary research in artificial intelligence for various surgical visual tasks to improve surgical visual question answering, robotic scene referring segmentation, and 3D reconstruction. The proposed methods cover a wide range of AI topics, including the design of network architectures and novel learning strategies such as vision foundation models, video-language learning, and Gaussian Splatting. The challenges, up-to-date progress, and promising future directions of intelligent robotic surgery will also be discussed.
