## Introduction  

HKUST SmartLab is pleased to announce that our paper, *"MedlAnomaly: A Comparative Study of Anomaly Detection in Medical Images,"* has been accepted by **Medical Image Analysis**. This study establishes a standardized benchmark for **anomaly detection (AD) in medical imaging**, covering **seven diverse datasets across five imaging modalities**, including **chest X-rays, brain MRIs, retinal fundus images, dermatoscopic images, and histopathology whole-slide images**.  

We conduct a comprehensive evaluation of **30 representative AD methods**, assessing their performance on both **image-level anomaly classification** and **pixel-level anomaly segmentation**. Furthermore, for the first time, we systematically analyze the impact of key methodological components in existing AD approaches, revealing **unresolved challenges** and **potential future research directions**.  

## Background & Motivation  

Anomaly detection (AD) aims to identify abnormal samples that deviate from expected normal patterns. It plays a crucial role in **rare disease recognition and health screening** in the medical domain. Despite the rapid development of AD methods, the field **lacks a fair and comprehensive evaluation**, leading to **ambiguous conclusions and inconsistent comparisons**.  

### Challenges in Existing Works  

1. **Dataset and Partition Variability**  
   - Many prior studies use different datasets or inconsistent data partitions, making it difficult to fairly compare methods.  
   - Some datasets, such as **Hyper-Kvasir** and **OCT2017**, are too simple for AD tasks. As shown in **Table 1**, even a basic **autoencoder (AE)** achieves nearly perfect performance on these datasets, suggesting they are not sufficiently challenging for benchmarking.

2. **Lack of Unified Implementations**  
   - Even within the same paradigm, different works adopt **varied network architectures and training strategies**, leading to unfair comparisons.  
   - For example, in **reconstruction-based methods**:  
     - **f-AnoGAN** uses residual blocks with multiple convolutional layers.  
     - **AE-Flow** employs a **Wide ResNet-50-2** encoder.  
     - **AE-U** relies on simple convolutional layers without specific designs.  
   - These discrepancies make it difficult to isolate the true effectiveness of each method.  

3. **Limitations of Existing Benchmarks**  
   - While some surveys and benchmarks exist, they **fail to provide a comprehensive and fair comparison**.  
   - For example, [1] analyzed various state-of-the-art (SOTA) AD methods but **did not include key non-recent yet representative methods** (e.g., different AE variants and self-supervised approaches using synthetic anomalies).  
   - Additionally, their study **did not employ unified network architectures**, making it difficult to analyze the inherent properties of each method.  

### Our Contributions  

To address these issues, we propose a **comprehensive benchmark** with the following contributions:  

- **A Taxonomy of AD Methods**: We categorize existing methods into **reconstruction-based, self-supervised learning-based, and feature reference-based approaches**, providing a structured overview of the field.  
- **A Curated Dataset Collection**: We compile **seven medical datasets** spanning **five imaging modalities**, ensuring a diverse and challenging benchmark.  
- **A Fair and Extensive Method Comparison**: We evaluate **30 representative AD methods** under standardized conditions and systematically analyze the effects of key components.  
- **Insights into Unresolved Challenges**: Our study highlights **critical open problems** and **future research directions** in medical AD.

## Taxonomy of Primary Methods  

### 1. Reconstruction-Based Methods  

**Basic Idea**: Train a model to reconstruct only **normal** images, then use the **reconstruction error** as an anomaly score. We divide these methods into:  
- **Image-Reconstruction Approaches**  
- **Feature-Reconstruction Approaches**

### 2. Self-Supervised Learning-Based Anomaly Detection  

- **One-Stage Methods**: Train a model to detect **synthetic anomalies**, then apply it to real anomalies.          
- **Two-Stage Methods**: First, learn **self-supervised representations** on normal data, then train a **one-class classifier** on the learned features.

## Conclusion  

This paper presents a **comprehensive benchmark** for **medical anomaly detection**, incorporating **seven datasets** and evaluating **30 typical methods**. Our extensive analysis reveals several key findings:  

1. **Reconstruction-Based Methods as Strong Baselines**  
   - Without pretraining, **reconstruction-based methods** outperform self-supervised learning (SSL) methods in robustness.  
   - The **simplest AE** serves as a **strong baseline**, achieving **near-perfect performance** on simpler datasets like **Hyper-Kvasir** and **OCT2017**.  
   - **Recommendation**: Future works should **always** include AE as a reference baseline.  

2. **Importance of Latent Space Configuration & Reconstruction Loss**  
   - **Latent Space Size**:  
     - Datasets with **local anomalies (near OOD)** benefit from **small latent sizes**.  
     - More complex datasets require **larger latent sizes** for optimal performance.  
     - Datasets with **global semantic anomalies (far OOD)** perform better with **large latent sizes**.  
   - **Reconstruction Loss**:  
     - **Perceptual loss** significantly outperforms **\( \ell_2 \) loss**, as it captures **semantic differences** rather than just pixel intensity.  
     - However, **current latent space and loss configurations remain suboptimal**, suggesting a **promising research direction**.  

3. **Effectiveness of Pretrained Models**  
   - **ImageNet pre-trained weights** are highly effective in medical AD, used for:  
     - **Distance measurement**  
     - **Input transformation**  
     - **Feature extraction**  
   - **Challenge**: Fine-tuning these weights for **task-specific datasets** remains an **open problem**.  
   - **Future Direction**: **Vision-Language Models (VLMs)** offer new possibilities for leveraging pretrained features.  

4. **Exploration of Special AD Settings**  
   - **One-Class Semi-Supervised Learning** and **Zero-/Few-Shot Learning** align well with real-world scenarios.  
   - **VLM advancements** facilitate **zero-/few-shot AD**, making this a promising future research area.  

Our benchmark establishes a **solid foundation** for future research in **medical anomaly detection**. By providing **fair comparisons** and **insights into key challenges**, we hope to guide the development of **more effective and robust AD methods**, ultimately benefiting **rare disease detection and health screening**.
