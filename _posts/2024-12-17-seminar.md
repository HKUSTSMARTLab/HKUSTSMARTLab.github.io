In this talk, Prof. Pan will discuss the possibility of obtaining accurately multi basis material images only from data collected in standard DECT. The work has implications also for photo-counting CT imaging. There is a renewed, increased level of interest in the development and application of advanced imaging technologies for acquisition of multi material images within a subject scanned, as such images can be exploited for differentiation of normal and cancerous tissues of low contrast difference and for quantification of material concentrations such as iodine concentration within the subject. While standard dual-energy computed tomography (DECT) can yield two basis material images, it remains of a high degree of theoretical interest and practical significance in obtaining multi (>=2) basis material images in DECT.
