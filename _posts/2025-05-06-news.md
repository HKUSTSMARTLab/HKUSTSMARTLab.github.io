### Top Honors for Biomedical AI Research

**LIU Runsheng** (COMP, Year 3), supervised by Prof. CHEN Hao from the Department of Computer Science and Engineering, clinched both the **Champion** and **Best Poster Award** for his groundbreaking project, “GAInS: Gradient Anomaly-aware Biomedical Instance Segmentation.”

Biomedical instance segmentation is crucial for accurately identifying and outlining structures such as tissues and cells in medical images. Traditional methods often struggle with overlapping or touching cells, treating each scenario separately and missing the connections between them. LIU’s GAInS approach introduces a new way to detect and refine these complex regions by analyzing the local gradient anomalies—essentially, the sharp changes in image intensity that signal different structures. His method uses a novel Gradient Anomaly Mapping Module (GAMM) to create detailed maps of these regions, and an Adaptive Local Refinement Module (ALRM) that fine-tunes the segmentation boundaries. The result is a system that outperforms current state-of-the-art techniques, as demonstrated in extensive experiments across multiple biomedical datasets. The work has also been recognized internationally, having been published at the [IEEE International Conference on Bioinformatics and Biomedicine (BIBM) 2024](https://www.computer.org/csdl/proceedings-article/bibm/2024/10822187/23oomcXkdfq).



### Advancing Medical Image Analysis with AI

**GU Yi** (COMP, Graduated), also supervised by Prof. CHEN Hao, was named **Second Runner-Up** for his project, “Deep learning for medical image analysis.” GU’s research tackles the challenge of detecting medical anomalies—critical for early disease diagnosis—using artificial intelligence. Traditional models are trained only on healthy data and must identify when something unusual appears. However, these models often struggle to confidently distinguish between normal and abnormal cases.

GU’s solution, D2UE (Diversified Dual-space Uncertainty Estimation), introduces two key innovations. First, a technique called Redundancy-Aware Repulsion (RAR) ensures that AI models learn to agree when analyzing healthy images and disagree when faced with potential anomalies. Second, his Dual-Space Uncertainty (DSU) method examines both the outputs of the models and how those outputs change with slight variations in the input, allowing for more sensitive detection of subtle anomalies. Tested across five medical datasets, D2UE demonstrated superior performance compared to existing methods, marking a significant step forward in AI-powered medical diagnostics.

### Looking Ahead
