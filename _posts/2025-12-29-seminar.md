Publishing in top-tier journals such as *Nature Biomedical Engineering* can be highly competitive and challenging. This seminar will provide an insider’s perspective on the editorial and review processes at the journal, and offer practical advice for researchers aiming to publish their work there.

Dr. Jennifer Haskell is an Associate Editor at *Nature Biomedical Engineering*, part of the Nature Portfolio. She joined the journal in September 2024 after conducting research at the University of Exeter, where she worked on applications of Raman spectroscopy for cancer detection. At the journal, she handles manuscripts in the areas of biomedical imaging, cellular immunotherapy, and genetic engineering, giving her a broad view of current trends in biomedical engineering research.

In this talk, Dr. Haskell will discuss what the editors look for in submissions, how manuscripts are evaluated, and common reasons for rejection. She will also share tips on framing your research story, preparing a strong manuscript, and navigating peer review. The seminar will be particularly valuable for early-career researchers and students who plan to submit their work to high-impact journals.
