## Introduction  
In pathology—the "gold standard" for cancer diagnosis—a global challenge of "AI specialization" has finally been overcome. Led by Professor Hao Chen from HKUST's Smart Lab, a team collaborating with Southern Medical University, Shanghai AI Lab, and other institutions has developed GPFM, the first highly generalizable foundation model in pathology. This "all-round champion" outperforms competitors across 72 clinical tasks spanning six major categories (diagnosis, prognosis, etc.), with results recently accepted by **<font color="red">Nature Biomedical Engineering</font>**, a top-tier biomedical engineering journal.

## I. The "Achilles' Heel" of Pathology AI  
Current pathology AI models suffer from "narrow expertise": some excel at tissue classification but fail to interpret pathology reports, while others predict survival accurately yet cannot localize lesions. The team established the first evaluation framework covering 6 categories and 72 clinical tasks, revealing existing models' average rank of just 3.7, with the best performer leading in only 6 tasks (see **Figure 2**). Such "specialist AIs" fall short in complex clinical scenarios, hindering smart healthcare adoption.  

## II. GPFM's Three Breakthrough Innovations  
1. **Pioneering a "Decathlon Arena" for Pathology Evaluation**  
   Covering 6 task types (whole-slide classification, survival prediction, pathology QA, etc.), this first-of-its-kind framework tests true generalizability.  
2. **Knowledge Distillation: Harnessing Collective Wisdom**  
   Novel dual-engine framework (**Figure 1.d**):  
   - *Expert Distillation*: Integrates strengths of top models (UNI, Phikon, etc.)  
   - *Self-Distillation*: Achieves cross-scale alignment of tissue features  
3. **Unprecedented-Scale Pretraining**  
   Trained on 190M image-level samples from 95K+ slides across 34 tissue types.

## III. Clinical Validation: Outperforming All Existing Models  
### 1. Whole-Slide Image Classification: New Benchmark in Diagnostic Accuracy  
Across 36 WSI classification tasks, GPFM achieved an average rank score of 1.22, surpassing runner-up UNI (3.60). Using AUC, GPFM reached a best-in-class average AUC of 0.891—1.6% higher than UNI (*P* < 0.001) (**Figure 3**).

### 2. Survival Analysis & Prognosis: A New Compass for Clinical Decisions  
In all 15 survival tasks, GPFM averaged rank 2.1 (Top-2 in 13 tasks), while UNI ranked 4.6 (best in only 4 tasks). Evaluated by C-Index, GPFM again led with 0.665 (3.4% gain over UNI; *P* < 0.001), demonstrating superior generalizability (**Figure 4**).

### 3. ROI Classification  
Across 16 ROI tasks, GPFM achieved the best average rank (1.88 vs. Prov-Gigapath’s 3.09) and highest mean AUC (0.946, +0.2% over Prov-Gigapath; *P* < 0.001) (**Figure 5**).

### 4. Additional Results  
See original paper for pathology image retrieval, VQA, report generation, and more.  

## IV. Boundless Clinical Translation Potential  
Powered by GPFM and mSTAR, the team developed **SmartPath**—a next-gen diagnostic system covering intraoperative modules for five high-incidence cancers (lung, breast, GI, etc.). Currently under active deployment, it promises to accelerate digital pathology adoption.
