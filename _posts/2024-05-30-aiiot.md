HKUST CSE Department is hosting a workshop on "Artificial Intelligence and Internet of Things (AIoT) for Healthcare" on 13 June 2024.

## Introduction
Artificial Intelligence and Internet of Things (AIoT) for Healthcare is a rapidly growing field that combines advanced technologies to improve healthcare outcomes. AIoT involves the integration of AI algorithms and IoT devices to collect, analyze, and interpret data from various sources in the healthcare industry. This technology has the potential to transform the way healthcare is delivered by enabling doctors and healthcare providers to make faster, more accurate diagnoses and treatment decisions.

This workshop aims to delve into the transformative potential of AIoT technology in healthcare services throughout the full lifecycle, encompassing hospitals, home, and community settings. Against the backdrop of population aging and smart healthcare, there is a higher demand for transformative healthcare services to address the issues of imbalanced healthcare resources and evolving patient needs. How to utilize AIoT to alleviate pressure on healthcare systems and provide personalized healthcare is the focus of this workshop.
