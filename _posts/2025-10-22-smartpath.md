**SmartLab** at The Hong Kong University of Science and Technology (HKUST) today launched **SmartPath**, a comprehensive artificial intelligence (AI) system designed to transform the entire pathology workflow for cancer care. Led by Assistant Professor **Hao Chen**, Director of the Collaboration Center for Medical and Engineering Innovation, SmartPath provides integrated support for clinical diagnosis, subtyping, biomarker quantification, treatment response assessment, and prognostic follow-up across a wide spectrum of cancers—accelerating turnaround times and enhancing personalized treatment.

### Groundbreaking Features for End-to-End Clinical Support

Developed from one of the largest and most diverse pathology datasets—over **500,000 whole-slide images** spanning **34 major tissue sites**—SmartPath assists healthcare professionals with **100+ clinical tasks**, including cancer classification, subtyping, treatment response evaluation, survival prediction, and automated pathology report generation.

SmartPath is powered by two integrated large AI models:

- **Generalizable Pathology Foundation Model (GPFM)**  
  A unified framework for accurate tumor identification, subtyping, and biomarker quantification across diverse tissues. GPFM supports survival outcome prediction and treatment response assessment, forming a data-driven foundation for personalized therapy.  
  Sources: arXiv (Towards a generalizable pathology foundation model via unified knowledge distillation, 2024), HKUST Smart Lab publications.

- **Multimodal Knowledge-enhanced Whole-slide Pathology Foundation Model (mSTAR)**  
  Fuses whole-slide pathology images with contextual data (pathology reports and transcriptomics) to enable minute-level automated report generation and powerful visual question-answering on slide regions.

Engineered for seamless clinical integration, SmartPath streamlines the cancer care cycle—from rapid slide analysis and proactive risk alerts to AI-assisted reporting—reducing diagnostic bottlenecks and enabling pathologists to focus on complex decisions.

### Proven Performance in Rigorous Clinical Trials

SmartPath is undergoing **multi-center prospective validation** with top-tier hospitals in Hong Kong and the Chinese Mainland. In comprehensive benchmarking, it significantly outperformed existing models. A **recent prospective study at Nanfang Hospital** reported **accuracy >95%** across multiple cancers (including lung, breast, and colorectal), confirming SmartPath’s ability to enhance diagnostic accuracy, reliably predict patient survival, and rapidly generate detailed pathology reports.

### Leadership Voices

Prof. **Hao Chen**, Director of the Collaboration Center for Medical and Engineering Innovation and Assistant Professor in the Departments of Computer Science and Engineering and Chemical and Biological Engineering, said:  
> “SmartPath has been built and validated with a strong network of clinical partners. Across a wide array of real-world clinical tasks, the system consistently ranks first in benchmarking—especially in malignancy identification and treatment response prediction. With continuous real-world feedback, SmartPath keeps learning and improving, setting a new standard for intelligent, personalized medicine.”

Prof. **Liang Li**, Director of the Department of Pathology at **Nanfang Hospital** and Professor at **Southern Medical University**, commented:  
> “Preliminary results from our prospective trials are highly encouraging. SmartPath improves malignancy identification, provides reliable prognostic predictions, and significantly shortens diagnostic turnaround time through rapid generation of preliminary reports—crucial for time-sensitive cancer cases. This is the future of pathology, where AI augments precision and empowers data-driven clinical decisions.”
