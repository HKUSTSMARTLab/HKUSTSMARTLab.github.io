**Report Title**: Intelligent Computing for Medical Imaging - Challenges and Practices

**Abstract**: With the rapid development of deep learning technology, intelligent computing for medical imaging has made significant progress, but it still faces many challenges, especially how to build high-performance and reliable models in the case of scarce labeled data and long-tail distribution of diseases. In order to cope with these challenges, the application of pre-training technology in medical image analysis has gradually attracted attention. Related research is committed to using relevant or even irrelevant medical image data to pre-train the model to improve its ability to analyze various modalities of medical images. On this basis, researchers are working to build large-scale foundation models and develop model fine-tuning techniques to improve the generalization performance of models on different diagnostic tasks. This report will delve into the main challenges faced by pre-training technology in medical image analysis, including insufficient data labeling, data dimensionality issues, limitations of model capabilities, and the construction of foundation models. By sharing the research experience and insights of the research group in these fields, this report will also explore the application opportunities and challenges of pre-training and foundation models in medical image analysis, in order to provide useful references and inspirations for researchers in related fields.

**Report Title**: Beyond The Eye: Exploring Neurodegenerative Diseases with Intelligent Analysis of Ophthalmic Images

**Abstract**: Due to the complexity of the brain, the ambiguity of evaluation indicators, and the lack of direct observation methods, early screening for neurodegenerative diseases such as Alzheimer's disease (AD) is a difficult problem in the medical field. Clinically routine methods such as PET, MRI, DSA, and cognitive tests have problems such as large equipment, high cost, radiation or trauma, and long detection time, which are not suitable for popularization at the grassroots level and large-scale population screening. Therefore, exploring efficient and non-invasive screening methods has become an urgent need and research hotspot for early prevention. The eye and brain have a high degree of developmental homology and functional similarity, and the eye has the potential to become an excellent observation window for studying the brain. This report will introduce the reporter's research work in multimodal ophthalmic medical image processing in recent years, mainly including image enhancement, structure extraction and segmentation, feature quantification, and disease diagnosis algorithm research. Focusing on the difficulties in large-scale screening of neurodegenerative diseases such as Alzheimer's disease, this report explores the correlation between brain diseases and various eye image features, reveals the internal connections and patterns between brain diseases and retinal structural changes, and provides a scientific basis and technical support for early accurate assisted diagnosis.

**Speaker Profile**: Yitian Zhao is a researcher and doctoral supervisor at the Ningbo Institute of Materials Technology and Engineering, Chinese Academy of Sciences, and the deputy director of the Advanced Diagnosis and Treatment Laboratory. He is mainly engaged in the research of artificial intelligence + ophthalmic medical image analysis. In recent years, he has focused on ophthalmic multimodal images and carried out intelligent diagnosis algorithm research and equipment development for eye, brain, heart and other related diseases. He has successively received support from the National Excellent Youth Fund, the Ministry of Science and Technology Key R&D Program Young Scientists, the Zhejiang Provincial Outstanding Youth Fund, and the China Association for Science and Technology Youth Talent Support Project, and has presided over more than ten projects including the National Natural Science Foundation. He has published more than 100 papers in top international journals and conferences in the industry such as Nature Machine Intelligence, npj Digital Medicine, IEEE PAMI, IJCV, IEEE-TMI, MedIA, CVPR, and MICCAI, with more than 9,200 academic citations and single paper highest citation times over 2300 times. He currently serves as an editor/associate editor for journals such as The Innovation (IF: 32.1) IEEE Trans. Medical Imaging (IF: 10.6) and Medical Physics (IF: 4.5).
