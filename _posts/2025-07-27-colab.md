### Foundation of the Partnership

Wuhan Union Hospital is one of China’s premier medical institutions, serving 6.9 million outpatients, 420,000 inpatients, and performing 156,000 surgeries annually—providing vital clinical support for large-scale, multimodal medical AI model development.

The collaboration between HKUST and Wuhan Union Hospital began in 2023, with the first official visit by Prof. Zhang Yu. In 2024, both parties signed a formal agreement and established the first base of the Medical-Engineering Joint Innovation Center at Wuhan Union Hospital. Since then, the partnership has achieved breakthrough progress in AI and medical imaging, including the development of the world’s largest ultrasound AI model trained on data from nearly one million patients, achieving diagnostic accuracy for thyroid nodules on par with experienced clinicians.

### Leadership and Research Excellence

The Center is jointly led by Prof. Hao Chen (Assistant Professor, Computer Science & Engineering, Chemical & Biological Engineering, and Life Science, HKUST) and Prof. Zheng Chuansheng (Director of Radiology, Wuhan Union Hospital), with Prof. Huang Ziwei (Associate Professor, Chemical & Biological Engineering, HKUST) and Prof. Xie Mingxing (Director of Ultrasound, Wuhan Union Hospital) as Deputy Directors.

Prof. Chen and Prof. Huang’s teams have recently developed four novel AI medical foundation models and an innovative cellular imaging technology capable of accurately detecting residual cancer cells, driving medical innovation and translating scientific breakthroughs into clinical benefit.
