## mRNA Drug Design by Artificial Intelligence

mRNA drugs have emerged as a forefront therapy, offering simplicity in production, heightened safety, and personalized treatment options. However, challenges such as low translation efficiency and instability persist. AI technology has recently emerged as a solution, enabling the autonomous design of novel mRNA sequences by deciphering their functional relationships without the need for extensive experimental data. This approach not only enhances our understanding of mRNA biology but also improves the design of potent mRNA sequences, streamlines experimental processes, boosts drug efficacy, and explores new avenues in drug design, addressing unmet clinical needs and global health challenges with precision.
