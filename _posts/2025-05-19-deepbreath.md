## Breast Cancer: A Global Challenge, AI as a Solution

Breast cancer remains the most common malignant tumor among women worldwide, characterized by significant heterogeneity and complex diagnostic needs. Medical imaging—including mammography, ultrasound, MRI, PET/CT, and pathology—plays a crucial role in detection and characterization. With recent breakthroughs in AI, automated breast image interpretation and clinical decision support are rapidly advancing, offering new hope for improved outcomes and personalized care.

## Three International Challenges to Advance the Field

Deep-Brea3th 2025 will feature three associated challenges, fostering open innovation and benchmarking in key areas:

- **ODELIA 2025**: Breast MRI Challenge
- **MAMA-MIA 2025**: Tumor Segmentation and Treatment Response Prediction in Breast MRI
- **UUSIC 2025**: Universal Ultrasound Image Challenge for Multi-Organ Classification and Segmentation

## Broad Scope, Focused Impact

The workshop welcomes submissions in all areas of AI for breast cancer, including (but not limited to):

- Breast imaging (mammography, ultrasound, MRI, PET/CT, pathology, etc.)
- Detection, segmentation, and classification
- Breast cancer screening and risk prediction
- Image registration, synthesis, and reconstruction
- Multimodal imaging fusion
- Treatment response and drug selection
- Lymph node status and molecular subtypes
- Tumor microenvironment and recurrence prediction
- Radiomics, reader studies, and federated/swarm learning
- Natural language processing and large language models

## High-Quality Peer Review and Open Science

Submissions are invited in two tracks:

- **Full Papers**: Up to 8 pages (plus 2 pages for references), double-blind reviewed, to be published in the Springer LNCS MICCAI Satellite Events proceedings. Selected papers may be recommended for high-impact SCI-indexed journals.
- **Abstracts**: Up to 2500 characters, including a supporting figure, for both new and recently published work. Accepted abstracts will be presented orally or as posters and made publicly available.

All accepted contributions are eligible for Best Student Paper, Best Workshop Paper, and Best Abstract awards.

**Submission portal:** [CMT Submission System](https://cmt3.research.microsoft.com/DeepBreath2025)

## Key Dates

- **May 13, 2025:** Submissions open
- **June 25, 2025:** Submission deadline
- **July 16, 2025:** Notification of decisions
- **July 30, 2025:** Camera-ready deadline
