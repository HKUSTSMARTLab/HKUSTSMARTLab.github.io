**Talk Title**: Medical Large Language Models: Challenges of Hallucinations, Bias, and Automated Evaluation

**Abstract**: Recent advancements in large language models have led to significant progress in various vertical domains, including healthcare. This talk will share our work on medical foundational models. Hallucinations are a major flaw in current generative AI, particularly in the accuracy-demanding field of healthcare. We propose a contrastive decoding method to alleviate hallucinations in medical large models during medical information extraction. Bias is another flaw in current AI technologies. We evaluate the biases of mainstream large foundational models in terms of gender, age, and disease severity using over 30,000 real medical records (corresponding to 193 diseases). We propose a method to mitigate model bias by improving prompt words, thereby enhancing diagnostic accuracy. Medical large models can be applied in various medical scenarios, including pre-diagnosis, diagnosis, and post-diagnosis. Previous evaluations of large models have focused on the diagnosis stage. We propose the MedJourney evaluation platform, which includes 12 datasets (5 of which are new datasets) to comprehensively evaluate the accuracy of general large models and medical large models in assisting the entire process of medical treatment. Evaluating open medical Q&A with models is challenging. Current evaluations are based on n-gram overlap rates or large model evaluation results, which have some discrepancies with expert subjective judgments. We propose the iMap data structure, which uses large models to extract key information from answers and then matches it with key information from standard answers to obtain evaluation results that better align with expert subjective judgments.

**Talk Title**: Task-Driven Intelligent X-Ray CT Imaging Algorithms and Applications

**Abstract**: Due to the physical characteristics of X-ray imaging and specific clinical requirements, the original X-ray CT data may exhibit non-ideal characteristics such as beam hardening, scattering, and data incompleteness, leading to artifacts in the reconstructed CT images that affect subsequent diagnostic and therapeutic tasks. Traditional data correction methods and reconstruction algorithms cannot completely overcome these problems; in recent years, intelligent algorithms based on large model technology have been widely used in the field of medical imaging, with the potential to overcome the shortcomings of traditional imaging methods. This report will introduce the team's research work on intelligent algorithms based on large model technology in X-ray CT imaging methods, including projection data correction, imaging algorithms for incomplete data, and spectral imaging methods, and discuss the extension of related research results to the development of domestically produced medical imaging equipment.

**Speaker Biography**: Xu Ji is an Associate Professor at Southeast University and a doctoral supervisor. He received his Ph.D. in Medical Physics from the University of Wisconsin-Madison in the United States and is currently an Associate Professor in the Department of Imaging Science and Technology at the School of Computer Science and Engineering, Southeast University. His research focuses on intelligent imaging methods for medical and industrial imaging systems. He has led or participated in multiple provincial and ministerial projects and has published over 20 first-author or corresponding-author SCI papers in internationally renowned journals such as IEEE Transactions on Medical Imaging and Medical Image Analysis. He has presented papers and oral presentations at major international academic conferences in the field of medical imaging, such as RSNA and SPIE Medical Imaging, and has received awards such as the Trainee Research Prize at the North American Radiology Annual Meeting. He serves as an Associate Editor for the leading medical imaging journal Medical Physics.
