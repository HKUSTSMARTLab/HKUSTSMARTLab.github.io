# Style Guide: Publications

## All sections

- Indent with two spaces
- Use double quotes for all string entries

# Title

- Only bold the first word and proper nouns
- Do not include a period at the end of the article title

# Authors

- Bold lab member names using the following format: **Firstname Lastname**
- Use one pair of double asterisks when multiple SMART lab members appear sequentially: **Young ID, Diaz RE, Liu LL**
- Use \* to add an asterisk denoting co-first/corresponding author. Otherwise, bolding of names using **Firstname Lastname** will break.
- Do NOT include a period at the end of the author list

# Images and PDFs

- All images and PDFs should be named using the following convention: "FirstAuthorLastname_YYYY"
- Leave PMID and PMCID blank until an ID is assigned.
- Remove any sections that are not relevant to your publication (PDB, data, Zenodo, Github repo, etc).
