# The Pathology AI Leaderboard

The Pathology AI Leaderboard is a platform for benchmarking foundation models in pathology. We host various tasks for benchmarking, including image classification, object detection, and segmentation. Participants can submit their models and compare their performance with others, and we provide a leaderboard for each challenge showing the top-performing models.
